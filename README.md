# YOLO Detection Filter
A K치lm치n-Filter for the smoothing of detections as produced by a YOLONet Machine Learning Model.


### Summary
This repository contains a K치lm치n-filter which intends to "smooth" detections of a YOLO NN when presented with time-coherent data, i.e. a video file (as opposed to individual disjunct images).
